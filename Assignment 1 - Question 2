// a) Test for additive and multiplicative seasonality in CPI after 1992m1. Is there evidence?

// Additive seasonality test by regressing cpi on monthly seasonality
regress cpi i.month if time>=tm(1992m1) 
// The monthly p-value is higher than 0.05. The F-test is significant. Overall, there is evidence of weak additive seasonality.

// Multiplictive  seasonality test by regressing the ln(cpi) on monthly seasonality
gen lcpi = ln(cpi)
regress lcpi i.month if time>=tm(1992m1)
// The monthly p-value is higher than 0.05. The F-static is significant. Overall, there is evidence of weak multiplicative seasonality. 


// Multiplictive  seasonality test by taking the month-over-month growth in cpi on monthly seasonality
gen dcpi= cpi/l.cpi-1
regress dcpi i.month if time>=tm(1992m1)
// The monthly p-value is lower than 0.05 near the end of the year. The F-static is significant. Overall, there is evidence of some multiplicative seasonality around the holiday season.

// Overall there is evidence of some seasonality in the month-over-month growth rate of CPI however, it is not conclusive evidence of additive or multiplicative seasonality in the CPI data.

// c) The Bank of Canada in February 1991 shifted it's approach to monetary policy by moving to inflation targeting within a range of 1% to 3%. This would have a significant impact on CPI through the Bank's new monetary policy approach as inflation was now being anchored at a low and stable rate, influencing how businesses and consumers make their day-to-day decisions. 
// We are testing whether there was a statistically significant change in the behaviour of CPI before and after that Bank of Canada's policy change.

// d) ADF TEST - Null hypothesis H0 : CPI data is non-stationary.
// ADF test on the level data
// Choose lags of the DF test using dfgls
dfgls cpi // By default, a trend is included.
dfuller cpi, lags(12)  // based on a Opt lag(12) from above
// Results: The ADF test shows that the test statistic of -0.188 is not more negative than any of the critical values at 1%, 5%, or at 10%. Thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the CPI time series is stationary. The p-value is 0.9399, higher than the conventional threshold of 5% which also indicates that there is not sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the CPI data is stationary as we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

// ADF test on the transformed data (first difference)
gen diff_cpi = D.cpi
dfuller diff_cpi, lags(12)
// Results: The ADF test statistic has a value of -4.089 and is more nagative than the critical values at 1%, 3%, and at 5%. Additionally, the p-value of 0.0010 is below the threshold of 5%. This indicates that there is enough statistical significance to reject the null hypothesis, implying that the differenced CPI is stationary. 


// KPSS TEST - Null hypothesis H0 : CPI data is non-stationary.
// KPSS test on the level data with trend
kpss cpi, trend
// Results:

// KPSS test on the level data without trend
kpss cpi, maxlag(12) notrend
// Results:

// KPSS test on the transformed data (first difference) without trend
